#convertion of 1 data type to another is called typecasting
a= "1"
b="2"
print(a+b)  #this performs str concatination
print(int(a)+int(b)) #now this is integer and we can perform add subtract etc
#implicite and explicite typecasting
#implicite conversion of datatype is done by python
#explicite where the conversion is done by the user

a = 9
b = 1.23
print(a+b)
